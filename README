Rhalo3stats
===========
This plugin makes it easy to incorporate Halo 3 stats from bungie.net in to your
Ruby on Rails application.

You will need a model with the following fields...

 - gamertag (string)
 - bnet_front (text)
 - bnet_ranked (text)
 - bnet_social (text)

Then in the model file, add has_halo3_stats to the top of it...

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_halo3_stats
  ... The rest of your model file ...
end

I'll add the information for the methods available soon, but for now, just 
look at lib/rhalo3stats.rb and you should be able to figure most of it out.
